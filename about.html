    <p class="henri">
        In the late 19th century, under the guidance of Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera, a new chapter began for Buddhist education in Sri Lanka.
        On a historic day, November 1, 1886, the Buddhist Theosophical Society inaugurated an English-Buddhist school at 19 Prince Street, Pettah.
        This humble beginning saw just 37 eager students, but it was the spark that would ignite a legacy.
           <br><br>

        As the school grew, it moved to 61 Maliban Street in 1888, accommodating 130 boys. The visionary C. W. Leadbeater became its first principal,
        laying the foundation for what would become Ananda College. By March 1889, the school was officially registered, boasting 120 students,
        with J. P. R. Weerasuriya becoming the first student to pass the prestigious Cambridge junior examination. That same year, A. E. Bultjens,
        a Cambridge graduate and devout Buddhist, took over as principal.
        <br><br>
        
         The school faced challenges, including a controversy due to its proximity to a Catholic school, prompting another move to 54 Maliban Street in 1890.
         However, this move only fueled its growth, with student numbers rising to 200 by 1892 and 270 by 1894. The generous donation of 3.2 acres of land by 
         Mr. Tudor Rajapaksha led to the school's relocation to Maradana, where, on August 17, 1895, it was proudly renamed Ananda College Colombo. 
         R. A. Mirando served as its manager until his passing during the 1915 riots.
        <br><br>
         Under the leadership of Patrick de Silva Kularatne in 1918, the school's enrollment skyrocketed from 450 to 1,000 students within two years.
         With a growing budget and an expanding student body, Ananda College continued to flourish. By 1961, it had officially transitioned into a government school,
         securing its place as a cornerstone of education in Sri Lanka.</p>

       <h3 class="principle">Ananda College Old Boys Association</h3>

       <p class="oldboy">The Ananda College Old Boys Association (ACOBA) was established in 1908, under the leadership of then Principal of Ananda College Don Baron Jayatilaka.
         The first Secretary of the Association was C.M. Raja. There are no records as to who the first Treasurer was, but Mr. J. Ratnasara has held the position of 
         Treasurer in 1916. Also no record of having written rules and regulations or a constitution for the ACOBA at the beginning. 
         The Principal of Ananda College was ex-officio the President of the ACOBA at the early years. The purpose of founding the ACOBA was to assist the school 
         in conducting the annual sports meet and also arranging the annual dinner was another objective.
         <br><br>
        There had been no life memberships, but the first annual membership fee was Rs. 4/-. It is recorded that the first dinner organized by the
         ACOBA was held on 11th August 1916 at the Olcott Memorial Hall, under the leadership of then Principal Fritz Kunz.
        <br><br>
        “Ananda College Journal” published in 1914, “The Anandian” printed in 1924. “The Anandian Jubilee Number” published in 1936 to mark the 
        golden jublee of Ananda College, “The Anandian Diamond Jubilee Number” published in 1946 on account of 60th anniversary of Ananda College 
        carried achievements of distinguished Old Anandians and also the news of ACOBA. It had been the practice to have the annual sports meet of 
        the College, day following the annual dinner of the Old Boys. This tradition had been followed for a long period of time. The annual sports
         meet day was known as the Old Boys Day.
        <br><br>
        The first branch office of ACOBA was established as Up Country (Kandy) Branch on 3rd February 1929. The first exhibition and trade fair
        organized by ACOBA was held from 31st October to 6th November 1936, under the leadership of then Principal and OBA President P. De S. Kularatne.
        <br><br>
        In December 1955, a distinguished Old Anandian S.A. Wijayatilake was appointed as Principal of Ananda College and was ex-officio the President of 
        ACOBA. He was the first old Anandian to be appointed so.
        <br><br>
        The tradition of Ananda Principal becoming ex-officio President of ACOBA was changed by amending the rules (constitution) in 1960. As per the provisions of the 
        new rules (Constitution) passed by the members on 14th February 1960, a distinguished Old Anandian Mr. D.W. Rajapathirana then Governor of Central 
        Bank was elected as the President of ACOBA. Since then the Principal of Ananda College was ex-officio the patron of ACOBA.
        <br><br>
        The constitution of the ACOBA had been amended on several occasions to suit then situations by broadening the objects, offering different 
        categories of membership (ie. Life, Honorary) expanding the composition of Executive Committee, accommodating the affiliated group etc.
        <br><br>
        Ananda College Development Fund was established under the ACOBA in the year 1970.
        <br><br>
        There was a structured change in the constitution to be in line with the Government regulations in the year 2017, since then the Principal of 
        Ananda College was Ex-Officio the President of Old Boys Association and in addition an Old Anandian is elected as the Executive President of ACOBA.
        <br><br>
        The ACOBA had been involved in many fund raising events such as exhibitions, trade fairs, carnivals, walks, lotteries, etc. 
        to finance various projects undertaken by them for the benefit of the students of the College. To name a few of them, in 1923 construction of 
        second hostel building, in 1953 Science Block, in 1978 Ananda Play Ground in 1986 Centenary Building (Administration Block), in 1993 the
         main Swimming Pool, in 2000 the Beginners Pool, in 2001 Statue of Col. Henry Steel Olcott, complete renovation and re-furbishment of 
         Kularatne Hall, construction of Ranviru Memorial in 2009.
        <br><br>
        It is not only the development of infrastructure but also ACOBA engaged in donating sponsorships to needy Ananda students annually.
       <br><br>
        The news of ACOBA are published in “Anandaya” newsletter publication in regular intervals.The “Anandaya” book on history of Ananda Collage 
        from 1886 to 2011 which was written during the presidency of Tilak Karunaratne was published by the ACOBA in 2017. 
        Issue of commemorative silver coin with face value of Rs. 2,000/- by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in 2011 to mark the 125th Anniversary of
         Ananda Collage was also at the request of ACOBA.
        <br><br>
        Ananda Collage Old Boys Association, Centenary volume 1908 - 2008 the hundred years history of ACOBA, was published in 2008.
